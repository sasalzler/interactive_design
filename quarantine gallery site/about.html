    <h3>about me</h3>
    <p>samantha is an animation major at alfred state college. she counts herself lucky for being able to have one semester of a normal college experience, where she was an active participant in the drama club production of all shook up. samantha is a theater kid and the quarantine really took a toll on her. not being able to express herself fully, adopting a dog and training him has been the highlight of her year and a way for her to cope with the tumultuous world around her.</p>
